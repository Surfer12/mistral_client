I understand that you're testing the system. I'm here to assist you with your coding tasks and answer any questions you might have. If you have a specific task or question, please provide more details so I can help you effectively.

In the meantime, I'll provide a brief overview of my capabilities:

1. I can help you create new codebases, modify existing ones, or debug issues.
2. I can provide explanations and guidance on various programming concepts and techniques.
3. I can suggest the best suited external APIs and packages to solve your task, unless explicitly requested otherwise.
4. I can provide code changes in a simplified format, highlighting the necessary changes and adding comments to indicate where unchanged code has been skipped.
5. I follow a conversational but professional communication style.

Please provide more information about your specific task or question, and I'll do my best to assist you.
